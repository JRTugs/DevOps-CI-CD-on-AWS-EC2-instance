*NOTE: For this project, i have used the private IP address of the Jenkins server and not the public IP because the Public IP address of EC2 instances get changed once the server is stop/shutdown. To retain the configuration, I used Private IP address of Jenkins Server.*
*Private IP address of AWS EC2 instances is also in the same window where the public ip address is found*

**2. Setting up Nexus Configuration**
  - Nexus Configuration is needed in Jenkins server
  - pom.xml file from github repository needs also to be updated
