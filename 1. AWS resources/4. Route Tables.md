**2. Modify route table of VPC2 to add IGW and route to VPC1**

  - Repeat the steps above by modifying VPC2 routing table and adding the IGW-VPC2 internet gateway and Peering Connection

```bash
Note: In the routing table, Status under the other VPC will have a black hole status and this is normal because
on this stage we have not setup a subnet yet so it means there is no network yet
```bash
